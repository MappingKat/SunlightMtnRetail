    "After exploring the historic sales and product data, it was decided that the \"category\" of the products needed some cleaning up in order to get better reporting on which items, colors, sizes sell the best, by which prices, discounts etc. Therefore in order to gain an understanding of how to <b>optimize product inventory and sales to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction</b>, the categories (like skis, bikes, bike parts, etc) need to be reclassified, reviewed, and fixed. Once, the categories and parent categories are correctly classified then we can look at questions like:\n",
    "Specific questions:\n",
    "* Which products sell the best and the quickest? Which brands?  \n",
    "* Which products, sizes, colors sells the most with no discounts, or full MSRP price?\n",
    "\n",
    "And further doesn the road, we can look at:\n",
    "* Which factors influence sales patterns (e.g., seasonality, promotions, external events)?\n",
    "* How can we accurately predict future demand for specific products or categories?\n",
    "* How can we personalize product recommendations to individual customers?"
