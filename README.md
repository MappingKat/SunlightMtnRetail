# Sunlight Ski and Bike Product Data Analysis: Optimizing Inventory and Sales

## Project Overview

Sunlight Ski and Bike, a beloved local store in Glenwood Springs, faces challenges in inventory management and sales analysis due to inconsistent product category data. This project aims to leverage data-driven insights to improve product categorization, identify top-selling items, understand sales patterns, and inform future business decisions.

## Problem Statement

Inaccurate and incomplete product categories hinder reporting, leading to:

* **Inefficient inventory management:** Stockouts and overstocking result in lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction.
* **Limited sales analysis:** Difficulty identifying top-selling products, understanding demand patterns, and making informed purchasing decisions.
* **Missed opportunities for personalization:** Inability to offer personalized recommendations based on customer preferences.

## Objectives

1. **Clean and standardize product categories:** Establish a clear and consistent classification scheme for accurate reporting and analysis.
2. **Identify top-selling products and patterns:** Uncover popular items, brands, sizes, and pricing dynamics to inform purchasing and promotion strategies.
3. **Explore seasonal and promotional influences:** Understand how seasons, promotions, and external events impact sales.
4. **Lay the groundwork for personalization:** Analyze customer purchase history to make tailored product recommendations.

## Data Description

* **Dataset:** Sunlight Ski and Bike's historical product data, including product details, sales figures, and customer information.
* **Key features:** Product name, category (inconsistent), brand, size, color, price, sale date, quantity sold.

## Methodology

### Data Wrangling

* Clean and format the data: Address missing values, inconsistencies, and incorrect data types.
* Create a new "ParentCategory" column to establish a hierarchical classification scheme.
